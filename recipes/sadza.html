    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Preparing the Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>slice up two onions into small chunks and store in an air-tight Tupperware container.</li>
        <li>cut up all tomatoes into 1/4" pieces and store in a large container</li>
        <li>skin and finely cut about 3 ounces of fresh ginger - and store in an air-tight container to maintain freshness</li>
        <li>cut up the chicken into 1/4-inch cubes</li>
        <li>cut up 1 bunch of scallions into 1/4" pieces and store in an air-tight container. Keep both the root and leaves!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparing the sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cover the bottom of a large sauce-pan with olive oil and apply medium to high heat.</li>
        <li>When the oil is very hot (and thin), stir fry the ginger alone for 1/2-minute.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and continue to stir fry. (Leave a tiny bit of ginger and onions for next step).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle enough chili powder to redden the onions and ginger.</li>
        <li>While stirring constantly also add a tinge of red pepper, a fair amount of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Add 1 - 2 teaspoons of salt and continue to stir. Using your finger, grab a half teaspoon worth of dried parsley leaves and pulverize it with your fingers while sprinkling in the pan. Continue to stir.</li>
        <li>The contents should shimmer from the heat and a spicy aroma should be evident.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to high. The heat will begin to brown/blacken the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the cut tomatoes in 4 to 5 portions at a time while stirring constantly. You aim to maintain boiling point while you add tomatoes.</li>
        <li>When all the tomatoes are in, and the sauce has reached/maintained boiling point, turn the heat down to medium and let boil for 10 to 15 minutes. Stir and mash the tomatoes occasionally.</li>
        <li>Re-sprinkle some more chili powder and stir. After five minutes turn the heat down to low, where the sauce is barely at boiling point. Cook for 10-20 minutes stirring and mashing the tomatoes as needed. [At this point if you have other things to do, you can simply turn the heat off and go off to do other things and return to the recipe later.</li>
    </ul>
